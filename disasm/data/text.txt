Well, [Hero],[Line]are you ready to[Line]face the enemy?[Wait2]
Anything else, [Hero]?
A change of heart, eh?[Wait2]
If that is all, then go now,[Line]for the hordes of Runefaust[Line]are still on the attack![Wait2]
Who do you wish to take?
Who will you leave behind?
[Hero], no one[Line]is waiting![Delay1]
Are you sure? After all,[Line][Name] needs to[Line]be revived.
Anyone else to replace?
Use whose item?
Who will use the [Item]?
[Hero]! What are you[Line]trying to do with that?[Wait2]
Any other item to use?
Transfer whose item?
Who gets the [Item]?
The [Item] is cursed[Line]and can't be unequipped.[Wait2]
Now, who gets it?
Anything else to transfer?
Who do you wish to equip?
[Name] has been cursed....[Wait2]
Anyone else to equip?
Discard whose item?
[Hero]! It would be[Line]foolish to discard the[Line][Item].[Wait2]
Anything else to discard?
View whose status?
Check someone else's status?
Without you, [Hero], who[Line]will lead the Shining Force?[Wait2]
[Name] can't be[Line]equipped with anything![Wait2]
Use whose item?
Who will use the[Line][Item]?
Nothing happened.[Wait2]
Transfer whose item?
Who gets the [Item]?
The [Item] is cursed[Line]and can't be given away.[Wait2]
[Name] can't be[Line]equipped with anything![Wait2]
Who do you wish to equip?
[Name] has been[Line]cursed....[Wait2]
Discard whose item?
[Hero] keeps the[Line][Item].[Wait2]
Wow! Dark Dragon, Ancients...[Line]Let's see now, what else does[Line]this old book say?[Wait2][Line]Hmmm. One thousand years[Line]have passed since they[Line]vanquished Dark Dragon.[Wait2][Line]And this book says[Line]Dark Dragon threatened to[Line]return right about now.[Wait2][Line]I bet anything that Dark[Line]Dragon is behind the evil[Line]hordes of Runefaust![Wait2]
I need to tell someone about[Line]this! But who would listen to[Line]a kid like me?[Wait2]
Oh, hi! I didn't notice you[Line]there at first. Maybe you'll[Line]listen. Nobody else will.[Wait2]
This book tells of an ancient[Line]evil that threatened our land[Line]long ago--Dark Dragon![Wait2]
I think Dark Dragon's coming[Line]back! Will you help us?[Line]C'mon, it'll be an adventure![Wait2]
Say, what shall I call you?[Wait2]
Nice to meet you,[Line][Hero]! I'm Simone.[Wait2][Line]Come back often[Line]and tell me everything![Wait2]
You need to get going! Evil[Line]spreads farther across Rune[Line]with every passing day.[Wait2]
Let's get going![Line]You're doing great so far![Wait2]
Which adventure would you[Line]like to continue?[Wait2]
Good luck! And be sure to[Line]stop by to let me know how[Line]you're doing, OK?[Wait2]
Really? Which adventure[Line]should I delete?[Wait2]
Are you sure?
OK, it's done![Wait2]
Which adventure do you wish[Line]to copy?
Where do you wish to copy it[Line]to?
Done![Wait2]
Change your mind? No problem![Wait2]
Come on! Let's get on with[Line]your adventure!
Oh no! I can't find adventure[Line][Num]! I hope you're not too[Line]mad![Wait2]
Done for now? That's OK. Get[Line]lots of rest, and I'll see[Line]you soon![Wait2]
Don't stay away too long,[Line]though. We need you here to[Line]lead the Shining Force![Wait2]
Pick an adventure.
Swallowed by the murky brine,[Line]the Castle of the Ancients[Line]was lost forevermore.[Delay2][Delay2]
The battle over and Rune[Line]saved, the warriors of the[Line]Shining Force returned home.[Delay2][Delay2]
Led by Mae, Guardiana was[Line]rebuilt and Anri inherited[Line]the throne.[Delay2][Delay2]
As for [Hero], he is[Line]believed to have perished at[Line]sea along with Dark Dragon.[Delay2][Delay2]
And that is the official[Line]ending. But you and I know[Line]differently, don't we?[Delay2][Delay2]
Somewhere, evil stirs in a[Line]land that has need of a[Line]hero.[Delay2][Delay2]
And I know you'll be up to[Line]the challenge, [Hero]![Delay2][Delay2]
Well, goodbye for now. I have[Line]a feeling I'll be seeing you[Line]again.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
Do you want to record your[Line]exploits so far?
Do you want to take a break?
[Name] discovers a[Line][Item]![Wait2]
But can't carry it![Wait2]
The treasure chest is empty.[Wait2]
Nothing is found.[Wait2]
[Name] gains [Num] coins.[Wait2]
[Hero] opens[Line]the treasure chest![Wait2]
[Hero] gets[Line]the [Item]![Wait2]

In ages long forgotten...
...Light fought Darkness for[Line]control of the world.
Dark Dragon led the evil[Line]hordes of Darkness.
The Ancients fought back with[Line]the Powers of Light.
Dark Dragon was defeated and[Line]cast into another dimension.
The Lord of Darkness vowed to[Line]return in 1,000 years.
Time passed, and Dark Dragon[Line]was forgotten by all.
Ten centuries of peace ruled[Line]the land of Rune.
Until the kingdom of Runefaust[Line]brought war and fear to Rune.
Hordes of evil creatures[Line]ravaged every land.
Here and there, strongholds[Line]of Good still held out...
...awaiting a Hero who could[Line]wield the Powers of Light!
Well, hello there.[Delay2][Delay2][Line]You look like you're[Line]a long way from home.[Delay2][Delay2]
We don't see many folk in[Line]full armor like that.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Line]Quite a fancy getup![Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
I have come a long way.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Line]Longer than you can[Line]imagine.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
I must say you do look pretty[Line]tired and, well,[Delay2][Delay2][Line]your things have seen[Line]better days.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
I'm tired of wandering.[Delay2][Delay2][Line]I'm looking for a place to[Line]settle down and rest.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
Well, how about right here?[Delay2][Delay2][Line]Lend your hands to the fields[Line]of our village?[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
That sounds like just what I[Line]need right now. [Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]I work hard[Line]and I'm a fast learner.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
Good! We've got a deal then.[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Line]Folks in the village will be[Line]excited to see a new face![Delay2][Delay2]
I didn't catch your name.[Line]What do they call you?[Delay2][Delay2][Delay2][Delay2]
Me? You can call me...[Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero]![Delay2]
[Hero]![Line]Goblins! Runefaust[Line]must be up to something![Wait2]
We can take them,[Line][Hero]![Wait2]
Move it, vermin! Find the key[Line]to this blasted door![Wait2]
C'mon, we're almost in![Wait2]
Where is that blasted key?[Wait2]
What? Blast it! Those fools[Line]from Guardiana are here![Wait2]
Earthquake![Wait2]
Attack, goblins and dwarves![Line]Strike a blow for the honor[Line]of Runefaust![Wait2]
Fools...you have won here,[Line]but Lord Kane of Runefaust is[Line]even now attacking Guardiana![Wait2]
If that creature spoke truly,[Line]we must return to help defend[Line]Guardiana![Wait2]
The earthquake blocked the[Line]road. Head north, but be[Line]ready for battle.[Wait2]
No one enters Guardiana while[Line]we live! For Darksol![Wait2]
Death to Guardiana![Wait2]
Well done, Shining Force![Line]Now, enter Guardiana and find[Line]out what's happened there![Wait2]
[Hero]! Enemies await[Line]you on the road to Alterone.[Line]Take all precautions![Wait2]
Excellent! Kane will have to[Line]do better than that to stop[Line]you. On to Alterone![Wait2]
Lowly worms, I shall crush[Line]you beneath my heel. Attack,[Line]soldiers of Runefaust![Wait2]
Lord Kane, Lord Darksol[Line]commands you to return to[Line]Runefaust immediately.[Wait2]
Tell him I'm on my way.[Wait2]
Yes, sir.[Wait2]
A shame I can't stay to watch[Line]you meet your doom! My troops[Line]can handle the likes of you.[Wait2]
[Hero], there's no time[Line]to lose. Kane must be found[Line]and stopped at all costs.[Wait2][Line]Find out all you can and[Line]be sure to talk to the king[Line]of Alterone![Wait2]
Our enemies seek to stop you[Line]from reaching Anri in[Line]Manarina. You must succeed![Wait2]
[Hero], now enter[Line]Manarina! We must inform[Line]Anri about Guardiana![Wait2]
Behold the dreaded Cavern of[Line]Darkness! You must defeat the[Line]monsters to gain the orb![Wait2]
No! It cannot be! After all[Line]these centuries....[Wait2]
[Hero], the Orb of Light[Line]must be within that chest.[Line]Take it quickly![Wait2]
Well, [Hero], remember[Line]me? You'll soon wish you'd[Line]taken my advice in Alterone![Wait2]
Come, my pets! Look who's[Line]come to play with you. Why,[Line]it's the Shining Force![Wait2]
I leave you in good hands,[Line][Hero].[Wait2][Line]I have more vital matters[Line]to attend to right now![Wait2]
Fools! Light will never defeat[Line]the Darkness....[Wait2]
She...that evil woman...was[Line]going to take me to Runefaust,[Line]to feed me to a dragon![Wait2][Line]Thank you! I'm going home and[Line]I'm never leaving![Wait2]
Been praying, and well you[Line]might![Wait2]
You and your pitiful Shining[Line]Force cannot be saved by[Line]prayers! You won't escape![Wait2]
How fitting that you perish[Line]in a former chapel of Light![Line][Wait2]
I leave you now in the care[Line]of my minions, who know well[Line]what to do with you....[Wait2]
Undead! Dispose of these[Line]pests once and for all![Wait2]
Master, we have found it![Wait2]
The Laser Eye! At last![Wait2]
This is the end of that[Line]cursed Shining Force![Wait2]
Get rid of those men from[Line]Bustoke. They are of no[Line]further use to us.[Wait2]
Alert! Intruders![Wait2]
What? The Shining Force![Wait2]
Stop them! We must have time[Line]to remove the Laser Eye![Wait2]
You think you've won, but[Line]you've failed. The Laser Eye[Line]is ours now![Wait2]
[Hero], the Moon Stone[Line]lies inside the cavern.[Wait2]
Look, they are trying to[Line]block our way to the bridge.[Line]Attack them, Shining Force![Wait2]
Head for the bridge. We need[Line]to get across quickly![Wait2]
Traitor! You've betrayed Lord[Line]Kane![Wait2]
I owe no allegiance to you or[Line]him, foul fiend that he is![Wait2]
You are only a mercenary. You[Line]do what we pay you to do![Wait2]
Here, I return your gold. I[Line]shall no longer follow your[Line]orders, toad![Wait2]
If you are not with us, then[Line]you are against us![Wait2]
I will have the pleasure of[Line]killing you myself![Wait2]
Vile fiend! Aiiiieeeee....[Wait2]
Ha, ha! Thus fall all who[Line]dare to oppose the will of[Line]Darksol![Wait2]
You may have beaten us here,[Line]but General Elliott will stop[Line]you in Pao![Wait2]
Whew! I thought I was a[Line]goner, but I caught a branch[Line]and just hung on.[Wait2]
A great battle! I don't know[Line]who you are, but I want to[Line]tag along![Wait2]
A good job getting to that[Line]Laser Eye. Hurry on to Pao.[Line]Evil is afoot![Wait2]
Thus the Shining Force[Line]brought peace to Bustoke. But[Line]a vast army awaits....[Wait2]
The time for battle has come.[Line]For King Ramladu![Wait2]
General Elliott is said to be[Line]the finest swordsman in all[Line]of Rune.[Wait2][Line]Take care, [Hero]![Wait2]
Perhaps you have the strength[Line]to rescue King Ramladu and[Line]Runefaust! Stop Darksol![Wait2][Line]Promise that you will free[Line]Runefaust, known as Protectora[Line]before Darksol came....[Wait2]
Elliott was a great warrior...[Line]too bad he was our enemy.[Wait2][Line]But look, the traveling town[Line]of Pao is coming up again![Wait2]
[Hero], you must break[Line]through to reach the harbor.[Line]Be careful, but be quick![Wait2]
At last we meet, [Hero].[Line]Soon you and your misfits[Line]will trouble us no longer![Wait2]
Yes, that is Balbazak, a[Line]commander of the Runefaust[Line]army. You must destroy him![Wait2]
[Hero]! Take the ship,[Line]but please spare my life![Line]Please![Wait2]
You don't want to[Line]kill me, do you?[Line]Please let me go.[Wait2]
Thank you! Take the ship, go[Line]after Darksol![Wait2]
Balbazak, you betrayed me![Wait2]
No, no, please Darksol![Line]Leave me in peace![Wait2]
You disgust me, Balbazak![Line]Leave you in peace? I will[Line]leave you in pieces![Wait2]
Forgive me![Wait2]
Too late, worm! Receive your[Line]punishment for failure![Wait2]
I am dying, [Hero]....[Line]You must kill Darksol...[Line]free Runefaust....[Wait2]
Take the ship, as that fool[Line]said. You will not survive[Line]the voyage! Ha, ha, ha![Wait2]
The ship is surrounded by[Line]monsters, [Hero]![Line]Prepare to defend it![Wait2]
The ship was damaged in the[Line]battle. We must repair it.[Line]That island over there....[Wait2]
Thank you for destroying[Line]those monsters! My name is[Line]Shell of Waral.[Wait2][Line]You can repair your ship in[Line]Waral. Please follow me![Wait2]
I've heard of Waral. We[Line]should be able to get the[Line]ship fixed there.[Wait2]
I invoke a path before[Line]me....What?[Wait2]
Shining Force! I was so[Line]close...so close! I shall[Line]destroy you all![Wait2]
Arrghh...I was so close...the[Line]way to Metapha...almost[Line]ours....[Wait2]
Here we go again. We were[Line]just about to land, too! Go[Line]get them![Wait2]
The ship's helm was destroyed[Line]in the battle. We're now[Line]adrift at sea![Wait2]
These Guardiana fools must be[Line]stopped. Kane's mission is[Line]vital. Attack![Wait2]
[Hero], you must quickly[Line]break through to Dragonia![Wait2]
You'll never beat Kane,[Line]Shining Fools![Wait2]
[Hero], you must[Line]stop Kane before he finds the[Line]Manual of the Seal. Onward![Wait2]
Ha! I knew you couldn't hide[Line]in there forever! Come on[Line]out, little hero![Wait2]
[Hero], be careful.[Line]Remember that Kane killed[Line]Varios![Wait2]
Arrgh! My mask[Line]is...breaking![Wait2]
Wh...where am I? I[Line]remember now. Darksol masked[Line]my face to control me....[Wait2][Line]What have I done?[Line]He even made me fight you![Line]Forgive me, [Hero]![Wait2]
It seems that Darksol is[Line]behind all the evil afoot.[Line]Stop him and it all ends.[Wait2][Line]In any case, let's take[Line]another look at this village.[Wait2][Line]Check the shrine again....[Wait2]
Well, [Hero], we meet[Line]once more.  For the last time,[Line]I fear, as you will die here.[Wait2][Line]My minions shall take care of[Line]you, but if they fail, I await[Line]you in Demon Castle![Wait2]
Mishaela is said to possess[Line]the Sword of Light. You must[Line]enter her castle and get it![Wait2][Line]With that legendary weapon,[Line]you stand a much better[Line]chance against Darksol.[Wait2]
Well, here's the little hero[Line]coming for my Sword of Light![Line]Take it, if you dare![Wait2]
You'll never leave my castle,[Line]you pitiful fools![Wait2]
This is as close as you'll[Line]ever come to the Sword of[Line]Light![Wait2]
[Hero], take great care.[Line]Mishaela is a powerful[Line]wizardess, a dangerous foe![Wait2]
Though you can take...my[Line]sword...you will never...stop[Line]Darksol.[Wait2][Line]Dark Dragon will be set[Line]free....[Wait2]
With the Sword of Light you[Line]might be able to defeat[Line]Darksol. We shall see![Wait2]
The Tower of the Ancients is[Line]to the east. Hurry, while[Line]there's still time![Wait2]
Now, on to the Tower of the[Line]Ancients![Wait2]
Stop them! Lord Darksol must[Line]not be disturbed![Wait2]
We must get inside the tower![Line]Smash through these monsters[Line]quickly, [Hero]![Wait2]
Lord Darksol...I have failed[Line]...they're coming...into the[Line]tower....[Wait2]
Get in there, quickly![Wait2]
Screech! Kill...kill....[Wait2]
This unit...now ceases to[Line]function...mission incomplete[Line]...system failure....[Wait2]
To the south is Runefaust.[Line]Their army approaches. You[Line]must fight your way in.[Wait2]
Now, [Hero], into[Line]Runefaust![Wait2]
Long have I waited for[Line]this moment, [Hero]![Line]Prepare to meet your death.[Wait2]
Is that the best you can do?[Line]Well, meet my robots,[Line]weaklings![Wait2]
I am dying...but my mind is[Line]once more my own. Darksol[Line]was controlling me.[Wait2][Line]You must stop Darksol![Line]If he frees Dark Dragon,[Line]all of Rune is doomed.[Wait2][Line]He has gone to the gate,[Line]to summon the castle from the[Line]depths of the sea. Go![Wait2]
[Hero]! Darksol has[Line]already entered the Castle of[Line]the Ancients.  You must hurry![Wait2][Line]I found a secret passage[Line]to the gate. It is in the[Line]entry hall of this castle.[Wait2][Line]Return to town and make[Line]your final preparations. Then[Line]take the passage.[Wait2]
At last, [Hero]!  The[Line]Castle of the Ancients. The[Line]end is near, for good or ill![Wait2]
None shall pass Colossus,[Line]the eternal sentinel![Line]Leave now![Wait2]
Colossus! I've heard of it[Line]in legends! [Hero]![Line]They are attacking![Wait2]
Fools...Dark Dragon...will[Line]come...to destroy you....[Wait2]
You've destroyed Colossus![Line]But where is Darksol?[Wait2]
Use the staircase,[Line][Hero].[Line]Darksol must be up there![Wait2]
Dark Dragon! Awake from your[Line]long sleep! The time has come[Line]for you to reclaim this land![Wait2]
Awaken, Dark Dragon![Line]Something is wrong....[Wait2]
[Hero]! Blast![Line]You have meddled for the last[Line]time! Kill them, my servants![Wait2]
[Hero]! You must stop[Line]Darksol before he completes[Line]his foul ceremony! Attack![Wait2]
Dark Dragon! With my dying[Line]breath...I summon you....[Line]Arise, Dark Dragon![Wait2]
Yes! At last, you are[Line]awakening![Wait2]
I offer myself to you, Dark[Line]Dragon! Use my power to help[Line]you cast off your bonds.[Wait2]
You are free once more! Let[Line]all of Rune tremble! I die[Line]fulfilled! Cringe fools![Wait2]
Nooooo! These puny creatures[Line]cannot defeat the Lord of[Line]Darkness![Delay2][Delay2]
Never! I will not be banished[Line]again! The Powers of Darkness[Line]will sustain me![Delay2][Delay2]
Dark Dragon still lives![Line]Perhaps we cannot kill him![Line]There must be a way....[Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero]! Dark Dragon[Line]must be sealed away once[Line]again. And only you can do it![Delay2][Delay2]
Use the Chaos Breaker! Drive[Line]it through Dark Dragon![Delay2][Delay2]
Fools! Nothing you do can[Line]stop me! I am Dark Dragon,[Line]Darkness incarnate![Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero]! Stab him with[Line]the Chaos Breaker![Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero] stabbed Dark Dragon[Line]with the Chaos Breaker![Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero]! The Castle of the[Line]Ancients is sinking! Let's[Line]get out of here![Delay2][Delay2]
But [Hero] cannot move![Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero] is somehow bound[Line]to the Chaos Breaker![Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero]! Break free! We[Line]won't leave without you![Delay2][Delay2]
I can't get free, but you[Line]won't die with me![Delay2]
[Hero] used his Egress[Line]magic to save us. But[Line]where is [Hero]?[Delay2][Delay2]
That spell's supposed to[Line]get us all out. Why isn't[Line][Hero] here? Why, Nova?[Delay2][Delay2]
I have no answers for you.[Line]Perhaps a great hero is[Line]needed to guard the seal.[Delay2][Line]Perhaps he must[Line]stand as an eternal vigil to[Line]prevent Dark Dragon's return.[Delay2][Delay2]
But why did it have[Line]to be [Hero]? Any of us[Line]would have taken his place....[Delay2][Delay2]
I won't believe it![Line][Hero] will come back,[Line]I know it![Delay2]
Perhaps [Hero] will still[Line]come out. Wait, look at[Line]the castle![Delay2][Delay2]
No! It's gone...the castle...[Line]and [Hero] with it....[Delay2][Delay2]
That's it. He didn't escape.[Line]He's gone....[Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero] has saved all of[Line]Rune. His sacrifice will be[Line]remembered forever.[Delay2][Line]And now, friends, it is[Line]time for us to begin the long[Line]journey home....[Delay2][Delay2]
I won't believe it....[Delay2][Delay2]
[Hero]!
Come, [Hero], our[Line]vengeance cannot wait![Wait2]
Forget about paying me. This[Line]is personal now.[Wait2]
At last! A chance to become a[Line]real knight! Count me in![Wait2]
I won't let you down,[Line][Hero]! You can depend[Line]on me, no matter what![Wait2]
I want to fight at the front![Wait2]
I can't thank you enough for[Line]letting me join the fight. I[Line]won't let you down![Wait2]
Let's get going, [Hero]![Wait2]
I'm ready, [Hero].[Line]You line 'em up, and I'll[Line]chop 'em down![Wait2]
I'm rarin' to go![Wait2]
[Hero], thank you for[Line]your efforts. I, too, shall[Line]try my best.[Wait2]
I'll fight to the end to[Line]defeat Darksol![Wait2]
I'm eager to try my magic.[Wait2][Line]Let's get out there and toast[Line]some monsters![Wait2]
I'll stay near the back, if[Line]you don't mind. But I can[Line]fight if I have to.[Wait2]
I'm most useful as a healer,[Line]but I'll get in a few good[Line]whacks when I have to.[Line][Wait2]I can heal wounds, but please[Line]try not to get injured, OK?[Wait2]
I can fight and heal wounds.[Line]Lead on, and I will follow.[Wait2]
Please take care not to get[Line]hurt. If your comrade gets[Line]hurt, I will help you.[Wait2]
If it's healing and fighting[Line]you need, I'm your man.[Line]I will try my best![Wait2]
With me along, there is[Line]nothing to fear from flying[Line]enemies.[Wait2]
Please don't put me in front.[Line]I can't stand being hit.[Wait2]
Where are our enemies? I'll[Line]blow them all away![Wait2]
Leave air combat to me! No[Line]one can take me as long as I[Line]have my wings![Wait2]
I will fight until Darksol[Line]is defeated or I'm finished[Line]on the battlefield.[Wait2]
Bring on those Runefaust[Line]creeps. I'll mop the[Line]battlefield with them![Wait2]
I feel my ancestors watching[Line]me as I prepare for battle. I[Line]will make them proud![Wait2]
I am yours to command,[Line][Hero]. Point out our[Line]foes and step out of my way![Wait2]
I was born to fight. The[Line]battlefield is like a second[Line]home to me.[Wait2]
Let's go, [Hero]! I can't[Line]stand the thought of those[Line]beasts overrunning Rune![Wait2]
Now your foes shall surely[Line]perish.[Wait2]
Is my helmet on straight?[Line]I think it is.[Wait2]
I'm just stretching. Need to[Line]keep in tiptop form, you[Line]know.[Wait2]
I'll just relax, maybe train[Line]a bit. I'll be here if you[Line]need me.[Wait2]
I think I'll go stir crazy[Line]if you don't let me out of[Line]here soon![Wait2]
Well, look who's here. Long[Line]time, no see, [Hero]![Wait2]
Sometimes it's good to stay[Line]down here. It's peaceful, but[Line]a bit noisy.[Wait2]
Can I fight now? C'mon, let[Line]me at that Darksol![Wait2]
Hiya, [Hero]. We've got[Line]quite a party going on back[Line]here. See ya later![Wait2]
This is pretty boring. When[Line]can I get into the fight?[Wait2]
I am ready for action. Just[Line]give me a chance.[Wait2]
[Hero]! This constant[Line]gossiping is really getting[Line]to me. Get me out of here![Wait2]
Boy, that Darksol is sure[Line]lucky I'm down here. He'd be[Line]in trouble with me fighting.[Wait2]
I'll be ready when you need[Line]me, [Hero].[Wait2]
Don't worry about us.[Line]We just started singing "1,000[Line]Bottles of Ale on the Wall."[Wait2]
ZZZZZZzzzzzZZZZZzzzzz....[Wait2]
I'm resting and practicing[Line]my healing spell.[Wait2]
[Hero], you should stay[Line]down here. It's great fun![Wait2]
Pick me! Pick me![Line]C'mon [Hero]![Wait2]
C'mon, [Hero], let us[Line]in on the fun! We're[Line]bored down here![Wait2]
[Hero], remember that[Line]we're here if you need us![Wait2]
Whaa...oh, sorry. I fell[Line]asleep there for a while.[Line]I'm ready now![Wait2]
Boooooring! I want action![Wait2]
It feels good to rest![Wait2]
Exciting times we live in,[Line]eh? Not that I'm seeing[Line]much of them, of course.[Wait2]
Just practicing my tail whip.[Line]Still haven't gotten the hang[Line]of it.[Wait2]
I want to punish Darksol for[Line]all he has done. Let me fight![Wait2]
Take care of your weapons,[Line]that's what my father always[Line]told me![Wait2]
Yawn. Sorry I must have[Line]dozed off. Did I miss[Line]anything important?[Wait2]
If I were to fight, they[Line]wouldn't even see me coming.[Wait2]
Do you like my helmet?[Wait2]
All that water beneath us. It[Line]makes me nervous![Wait2]
Don't worry. We'll be fine[Line]once a battle starts.[Wait2]
Nice ship. Good workmanship.[Line]We have nothing to fear![Wait2]
I'll be OK. I'll just carry a[Line]bucket with me into battle.[Wait2]
No seasickness for me! But I[Line]swim like a rock.[Wait2]
I feel ill. Don't make me[Line]fight, please.[Wait2]
Ah, the sea. I have long[Line]wished for a sea voyage.[Wait2]
My first time at sea. Pretty[Line]exciting.[Wait2]
I hate the sea![Wait2]
Did I hear "Land Ho!"? No?[Line]Just wishful thinking, I[Line]guess.[Wait2]
Monsters? Let me at 'em![Wait2]
So this is a ship? Rad![Wait2]
I'm tired of looking at the[Line]same people all the time.[Wait2]

This is a strange village. It[Line]would be sure death to face a[Line]powerful foe here alone.[Wait2]
You still have a long way to[Line]go. Use magic wisely. Give[Line]herbs to everyone.[Wait2]
Word has reached me that[Line]Mishaela is gathering forces[Line]to stop you. Be very careful![Wait2]
Thick woods are tough to get[Line]through. Close your ranks and[Line]fight as a unit.[Wait2][Line]Move cautiously against[Line]flying opponents. They move[Line]faster than your troops.[Wait2]
[Hero]! Is there anyone[Line]left to promote? Now is[Line]the time![Wait2]
Your strongest foes and[Line]hardest battles are[Line]still ahead of you.[Wait2]
Keep weaker folk away from[Line]the front lines![Wait2]
Darksol has gathered his best[Line]warriors for the final[Line]battles. Prepare yourself![Wait2]
Against a mechanical enemy,[Line]brute force may be the best[Line]strategy.[Wait2]
Do not exhaust yourselves[Line]here. Use Egress to retreat[Line]from overwhelming odds.[Wait2]
I have no more advise for[Line]you. Fight as best you can.[Wait2]
I have no more advice for[Line]you. Fight as best you can.[Wait2]
[Hero]? [Hero]?[Line]C'mon, kid, wake up![Line]I didn't hit you that hard.[Wait2]
Keep your guard up, kid.[Line]Those beasts of Runefaust[Line]will tear you to pieces![Wait2]
OK, that's enough for today.[Line]You'd better take it easy for[Line]a while.[Wait2]

No, [Hero], I think[Line]you've had enough for[Line]today![Wait2]
Well, [Hero], had enough[Line]swordplay for today?[Wait2]
I don't know how you keep at[Line]it hour after hour. I'm dead[Line]tired after about 15 minutes![Wait2]
You have the makings of a[Line]great fighter, [Hero].[Line]You'll be tested soon enough.[Wait2]
Lord Varios, the king has[Line]sent for you. You must come[Line]at once![Wait2]
Of course. Lead the way,[Line]guardsman.[Wait2]
I fear the worst, [Hero]![Line]Prepare yourself for true[Line]battle immediately![Wait2]
Did you see Varios' face? He[Line]went pale! Something really[Line]big is happening.[Wait2]
Let's split up and see if we[Line]can't find out what's going[Line]on. I'll see you later.[Wait2]

Eh? What's a youngster like[Line]you doing moping around? Get[Line]out and fight evil![Wait2]
I'm sick of feeling helpless![Line]I'm going to ask Varios to[Line]train me to be a fighter![Wait2]
Back and forth, up and down![Line]Man, I'm tired of guarding[Line]this chapel all day![Wait2]
Guardiana is beautiful! Clean[Line]water, fresh air, and green[Line]grass. Delightful![Wait2]
The Castle of Guardiana lies[Line]just ahead. Varios went in[Line]just a while ago.[Wait2]
My poor girl! I can't seem to[Line]calm her down![Wait2]
I...I had an awful dream. The[Line]whole town burned down.[Line]Sniff. Our house, too.[Wait2]
We're all upset about our[Line]daughter's nightmare. Do you[Line]think it means anything?[Wait2]
Someday I hope to go to[Line]Manarina to become a mage.[Wait2]
Sigh, not another customer![Line]Buy, sell, buy, sell. That's[Line]all I do! Just go away![Wait2]

Pay the old man no heed,[Line]youngster. His mind isn't[Line]what it used to be![Wait2]
Be careful, [Hero]. The[Line]knights resent the time Lord[Line]Varios spends training you![Wait2]
Bad times, my friend. Not a[Line]guest in two weeks![Wait2]

Grrr! Woof, woof! Arf![Wait2]
Sorry, but I'm busy packing.[Line]Grandpa's out somewhere. He[Line]has time to talk![Wait2]

Have you seen my cart? It[Line]rolls away all the time.[Line]Needs new brakes, I guess.[Wait2]
Hello, [Hero]! I've been[Line]having the worst nightmares.[Line]Have you had any?
I bet they're the same ones[Line]I've been having![Wait2]
Well, then, let me tell you[Line]about mine.[Wait2]
I saw our land in ruins. Evil[Line]creatures roamed our halls![Line]It seemed so real![Wait2]
Varios seemed very upset when[Line]he passed this way. Perhaps[Line]you should look for him.[Wait2]
I sense you are headed into[Line]great danger, [Hero].[Line]Can I be of any assistance?[Wait2]
There are so many monsters[Line]outside the city gates![Line]There's no escape![Wait2]
Hey there, youngster. My name[Line]is Gort. Care to hear my[Line]story?
I understand. I had things[Line]to do when I was your age.[Line]Perhaps some other time.[Wait2]
Thanks. No one talks to me[Line]anymore. All too busy. Want[Line]to hear a secret?
Never trust anyone outside[Line]this city! Murderers and[Line]thieves, all of 'em![Wait2][Line]I ought to know. I used to[Line]be a great warrior. Been all[Line]over the world.[Wait2][Line]Why, I have half a mind to go[Line]out again. Would if I got a[Line]good offer.[Wait2]
Hey! What are you doing?[Wait2]
Hey! Watch it, pal! How'd you[Line]like it if I tried to run you[Line]over with a cart?[Wait2]
0
An order from the castle.[Line]No one leaves.[Wait2]
Sorry, [Hero]. Talk to[Line]the king if you want to[Line]leave. Orders are orders![Wait2]
I see that you have the King's[Line]permission to leave. Good luck![Wait2]
If you sense great danger,[Line]don't hesitate to retreat.[Line]Use your Egress spell.[Wait2]
This is Guardiana Castle![Wait2]
This is Guardiana Castle![Wait2]

The king seems very worried.[Line]Do you know why?
Well! You young people think[Line]you know everything![Wait2]
My guess is that thoughts of[Line]the Gate of the Ancients[Line]trouble our noble king![Wait2]
Princess Anri is away in[Line]Manarina. Do you know about[Line]the land of Manarina?
I see you are well-informed.[Wait2]
Manarina holds an Arcane[Line]College, where the best mages[Line]are trained.[Wait2]
Grrr! I'm so mad! Do you want[Line]to know why?
It's that Tao! How dare she[Line]call herself a mage? If she's[Line]a mage, I'm a footstool![Wait2]
Why I never! How rude![Wait2]
Pardon me, I must clean the[Line]king's bedroom. No time to[Line]talk. Messy, messy, messy![Wait2]
Take care, [Hero]. It is[Line]more dangerous out there than[Line]you suspect! Or so I've heard.[Wait2]
Flee when you are in great[Line]danger. A dead hero is of[Line]little use to anyone![Wait2]
No one enters here without[Line]Lord Varios' permission![Wait2]
Everybody's waiting. Please[Line]go inside, quickly![Wait2]
Good luck, [Hero]![Wait2]
Greetings, [Hero].[Line]I am Mae, Varios' daughter.[Wait2]
The other knights feel that[Line]father has wasted his time on[Line]you. We shall see![Wait2]
...that is the story, Varios.[Wait2]
Mmmm....Then, your majesty,[Line]we have no choice but to send[Line][Hero], a young fighter.[Wait2]
First you must listen to what[Line]the king has to say.[Wait2]
For centuries, our people[Line]have watched the Gate of the[Line]Ancients, as its guardians.[Wait2][Line]Beyond that gate lies we know[Line]not what, not even if it is of[Line]the Light or the Darkness.[Wait2][Line]But the Ancients knew, and[Line]they sealed it beyond the gate[Line]and set us as guards.[Wait2][Line]And now we find that we may[Line]have failed in our mission,[Line]our reason for existence.[Wait2][Line]Signs have been seen that[Line]forces of Runefaust are at the[Line]Gate of the Ancients![Wait2][Line]Whatever evil they are[Line]planning, we must stop it[Line]at all costs and at once![Wait2]

But we must not panic the[Line]people. A small group of[Line]young but skilled warriors...[Wait2]
Yes! He could do it. He could[Line]leave town unnoticed and have[Line]a chance to succeed, perhaps.[Wait2]
Hummph! Seems like a mighty[Line]poor plan to me! But who[Line]listens to my advice?[Wait2]
Yes, Nova, I agree.[Line][Hero]! Will you[Line]take the task?[Wait2]
Very well! Now, return to[Line]town and gather your troops.[Line]Come back when you're ready.[Wait2]
What? You refuse?! It seems[Line]that Varios was wrong about[Line]you, after all. Too bad.[Wait2]
Have you reconsidered? Will[Line]you go to the Gate of the[Line]Ancients and investigate?[Wait2]
Gather your troops, quickly.[Line]There is no time to lose![Wait2]
You have your troops, but you[Line]need supplies. Take this to[Line]purchase what you need.[Wait2]
I'll leave everything to you.[Line]I must fortify the castle.[Wait2]
It'll never work! We're all[Line]doomed, I tell you. Doomed![Wait2]
([Hero] gains 100 coins!)[Wait2]
A cart will take you to the[Line]Gate of the Ancients. Go now[Line]and carry out your task![Wait2]
Good luck, [Hero]. You[Line]must succeed or Guardiana[Line]falls![Wait2]
Oh, [Hero]. Good. I was[Line]going to look for you.[Line]First, listen to the King.[Wait2]
Whew! Training wears me out.[Wait2]
Beat it, [Hero]! This[Line]training field's too rough[Line]for the likes of you![Wait2]
We'll make quick work of[Line]those Runefaust beasts![Wait2]
The Guardiana knights have no[Line]need of you, [Hero]![Wait2]
Don't let them get to you,[Line][Hero]. Some knights are[Line]always complaining.[Wait2]
We have trained until our[Line]arms are ready to fall off![Line]When will we see battle?[Wait2]
These are my quarters. Find[Line]someplace else to sleep![Wait2]
Why you? Why couldn't I lead[Line]the Shining Force? Arrrgh![Wait2]
Sir, yes, sir![Wait2]
What's that troops? I can't[Line]hear you! Louder![Wait2]
Oh my! What a lovely view![Wait2]
[Hero] looks into[Line]the telescope.[Wait2]
A huge eye! Aiiiieeee![Wait2]
Whoa! You scared me for a[Line]bit there! I was just looking[Line]around, admiring the land.[Wait2][Line]Lately I've seen moving[Line]people or creatures near the[Line]Gate of the Ancients....[Wait2]
It is indeed a lovely view.[Wait2]
Huh?[Wait2]
Hey, cut that out! You can't[Line]just push your way in here.[Line]Get out![Wait2]
Wait, [Hero]! Nova sent[Line]us. We're going with you. I am[Line]Luke the warrior.[Wait2]
Ken the knight, at your[Line]service, [Hero]! I'll[Line]follow wherever you lead.[Wait2]
I am Tao. I'm only an[Line]apprentice mage, but I'll do[Line]my best.[Wait2]
I am Hans, an elven archer.[Line]I'm coming, but don't put me[Line]in the front lines, OK?[Wait2]
([Name] joins the[Line]Shining Force!)
Hey, [Hero]! Don't try to[Line]sneak out of town without[Line]me![Wait2]
Now that you have your[Line]comrades, return to the king[Line]to hear his final commands.[Wait2][Line]I'll follow your progress[Line]and offer advice as you face[Line]the vile hordes of Runefaust.[Wait2]
Meet us at headquarters back[Line]in the castle![Wait2]
[Dict][Wait2]
Well, that's settled. See you[Line]at headquarters![Wait2]

I'll be at headquarters.[Wait2]
You made it back! You're a[Line]little late. We were almost[Line]overrun by Runefaust![Wait2]
We held them off, but we've[Line]suffered greatly, as you'll[Line]see as you wander around.[Wait2]
Most of our knights were lost[Line]in the battle...many homes[Line]were damaged. But we held![Wait2]
The king is eager to see you.[Line]He's up in the castle,[Line]planning our defense.[Wait2]
We'll keep watch here.[Line]Runefaust is bound to attack[Line]again, sooner or later.[Wait2]
Don't worry about your[Line]comrades. We've sent them up[Line]to headquarters.[Wait2]
We'll keep watch here.[Line]Runefaust is bound to attack[Line]again, sooner or later.[Wait2]

Blasted telescope! What good[Line]is it if I couldn't spot the[Line]Runefaust army with it?[Wait2]
The treasure...they took all[Line]they could carry. Get it[Line]back, [Hero]![Wait2]

Take care, [Hero].[Line]No place is safe now.[Wait2]

Hurry, [Hero]! Kane of[Line]Runefaust has injured the[Line]king and Lord Varios![Wait2]
Go away, Kane![Line]I don't understand what[Line]you are talking about![Wait2]
Anyway, the treasure of[Line]Guardiana is in my hand now.[Wait2]
I won't let you take that![Line]Just leave![Wait2]
Sword of Darkness![Line]Show me your power!![Wait2]
(Varios dies.)[Wait2]
No! Father![Line]I... I can't believe it![Line][Delay2]I'll, I'll...[Wait2]
Now, Guardiana is unworthy[Line]of my attention.[Line]Farewell, fools![Wait2]
[Hero]![Line]Look to the king![Wait2]
[Hero]...Mae...[Line]I don't think I'll live[Line]much longer, though Varios[Wait2][Line]protected me. Listen,[Line]the gate of the Ancients is[Line]the only access to the Tower.[Wait2][Line]And the gate can be opened[Line]only by the key.[Line]You must find it before it[Wait2][Line]falls into the hands of evil![Line]You should never let them[Line]open the gate![Wait2][Line]Find out why Runefaust is[Line]interested in the gate...[Wait2][Line]Please...[Wait2]
Mae...[Line]Daughter of the great[Line]Varios, help [Hero]...[Wait2][Line]avenge your father!...[Line]and be strong...[Wait2]
Your majesty....[Wait2]
Please tell my daughter,[Line]Anri, in Manarina...to stay[Line]strong, for her people....[Wait2]
(The king dies.)[Wait2]
Now is not the time for tears[Line]and grief. Alterone should be[Line]out next goal.[Wait2]

I'll await you at headquarters.[Line][Delay2]Be quick![Wait2]
I was so scared...[Line]Kane...[Line]His single glance froze me![Wait2]
[Hero]![Wait2]

[Dict].....[Delay2][Line].....[Wait2]
Arrrghhh![Wait2]
Will your journey take you to[Line]the town of Manarina?
Oh. That's too bad....[Wait2]
Then see Princess Anri! She[Line]can help you.[Wait2]
Good luck, [Hero]![Wait2]
Good luck, [Hero]![Wait2]
Alterone? It lies to the[Line]northeast.[Wait2]
Alterone is an ally of ours.[Line]I wonder if it was also[Line]attacked by Runefaust.[Wait2]
It's a mystery to me why[Line]Runefaust attacked us.[Wait2]

Be very careful when you meet[Line]the king. That's all I dare[Line]say.[Wait2]

What? Runefaust attacked[Line]Guardiana? Hard to believe.[Line]Follow me, [Hero].[Wait2][Line]I have a...tactician we[Line]should consult with on this[Line]matter.[Wait2]
No one enters. We have[Line]important guests.[Wait2]
The king is waiting for you.[Wait2]
I'm sorry about this, but I[Line]must protect Alterone.[Wait2]
I have nothing to say to you,[Line][Hero] of Guardiana.[Wait2]
Surprised, [Hero]?[Wait2][Line]Alterone has already[Line]surrendered![Line]Put him in a prison cell![Wait2][Line]I'll decide how to best[Line]dispose of him in a day[Line]or two.[Wait2]
Kane, you promised that[Line]Alterone would not be[Line]involved in any of this![Wait2]
Quiet, fool! Or I'll[Line]throw you in the cell with him![Line]Take him away.[Wait2]
(The bars are solid. There's[Line]no way to break them.)[Line]...Footsteps approach![Wait2]
The time has come to strike[Line]back at Runefaust! I'm letting[Line]you out.[Wait2]
Please help me save Alterone![Line]I'll fight alongside you. I[Line]can heal too![Wait2]
There's a secret passage. Use[Line]it to escape.[Wait2]
I'll be at headquarters.[Wait2]
We can't go this way. They'll[Line]spot us for sure.[Wait2]
Please be patient a[Line]little longer. I'll get you[Line]out of here soon.[Wait2]
I came to tell the king to[Line]fight, but Kane had already[Line]convinced him to surrender.[Wait2]
Even though I am in prison, I[Line]can still perform my duties.[Line]How can I help you?[Wait2]
I was freed when you won the[Line]battle. Thank you! Perhaps I[Line]can help you now.[Wait2]
What? Guardiana was[Line]attacked? By Runefaust?[Line]Rubbish! Get out of here![Wait2]
You heard him--beat it![Wait2]
Our king is entertaining an[Line]important guest. Who do you[Line]think you are to barge in?[Wait2]
The king has given orders[Line]that you may enter. Highly[Line]unusual, but go on in.[Wait2]
Welcome to Alterone Castle![Wait2]
Welcome to Alterone Castle![Wait2]
I'm glad to see you alive[Line]again, [Hero].[Wait2]
Khris's going with you?[Line]I'll hold you responsible if[Line]she gets hurt![Wait2]
Sorry, [Hero], no time to[Line]chat. I've got a castle[Line]to guard![Wait2]
Good job, [Hero]. We'll be[Line]on guard from now on.[Wait2]
Watching you fight was[Line]inspiring. No more sitting[Line]around all day for me!.[Wait2]
Well, I hope you're proud of[Line]yourself. You've ruined my[Line]business![Wait2]
To think that we let a snake[Line]like Kane in here. Never[Line]again, [Hero]![Wait2]

Kane of Runefaust spoke of a[Line]door and a key. Has he found[Line]the key yet?
We're doomed! That door is[Line]said to hold back an ancient[Line]evil. All is lost![Wait2]

There is a chain inside the[Line]head! Do you wish to pull it?

Here, fishee, fishee, fishee![Wait2]
I'm not going to give up![Wait2]
What a rude thing to do![Wait2]
Mud all over my new dress![Line]Arrggh! I can't stand it![Wait2]
I'll get you![Wait2]
Watch out! I don't want you[Line]to splash mud on my beautiful[Line]new dress![Wait2]
Who are you? Go back to[Line]wherever you came from![Wait2]
Thank you, [Hero].[Line]Alterone is now free,[Line]thanks to you.[Wait2]
Never trust Runefaust, that's[Line]what I always say.[Wait2]
Thank you, for getting rid of[Line]that evil Kane person.[Wait2]
I hear there's an underground[Line]passage in the castle. Sssh![Line]Let's keep it a secret.[Wait2]

Hey, where did that witch go?[Line]She's up to no good, mark my[Line]words![Wait2]
I think I'll return to[Line]Guardiana. They need me.[Wait2]
We were never in any real[Line]danger. Who would hurt us?[Wait2]
Perhaps in Manarina they'll[Line]know how to deal with Kane.[Wait2]
I wish you well in your[Line]quest! Come back when it's[Line]over and you can relax.[Wait2]

That was as close as I ever[Line]want to get to a battle![Wait2]
We're going to help rebuild[Line]Guardiana. It's the least we[Line]can do to repay you.[Wait2]

Whew! It was amazing. I've[Line]never seen a battle from that[Line]close before![Wait2]
Battles in the streets, friars[Line]in prison....What's this town[Line]coming to?[Wait2]
Thank you for driving away[Line]those Runefaust beasts.[Wait2]
I would have fought with you,[Line]but I didn't want the battle[Line]to be too lopsided.[Wait2]

Oh, well, it was nice while[Line]it lasted.[Wait2]
Good luck, [Hero]. Give[Line]Kane a wallop for us![Wait2]
Before you came, the knights[Line]of Runefaust spoke of the town[Line]of Rindo.[Wait2]
Ah, Rindo. Lots of money[Line]there! Yes, yes, a fine town.[Wait2]

That Dr. Crock! A brilliant[Line]man, but no common sense.[Wait2]
Sorry, stranger. Soldiers[Line]bought almost all our ships.[Line]That one is the mayor's.[Wait2]
The answer's still "No!"[Line]That's the mayor's ship. Go[Line]talk to him if you like.[Wait2]
The mayor's ship is yours![Wait2]
This is bad! That was the[Line]only ship in town. Maybe the[Line]mayor can help you again.[Wait2]
I'm sure the mayor is[Line]grateful that you saved his[Line]grandson. Go talk to him.[Wait2]
I can't wait for the circus![Line]Isn't it exciting?[Wait2]
The tent is up, but when will[Line]the circus start?[Wait2]
Guardiana's Princess Anri is[Line]in Manarina. I hope things[Line]are quieter there.[Wait2]
Did you meet Princess Anri?[Line]Isn't she wonderful?[Wait2]
Yes, I am the mayor. Kane of[Line]Runefaust bought all our ships[Line]and sailed away.[Wait2][Line]So sorry, no ships are left.[Line]My ship? You can't have it![Line]Now please leave.[Wait2]
Didn't you hear me?[Line]Get lost![Wait2]
I have a favor to ask of you.[Line]Grant it and the ship is all[Line]yours! What do you say?[Wait2]
Well, then, no ship. Please[Line]leave.[Wait2]
My grandson is missing. If[Line]you find him and bring him[Line]back, my ship is yours.[Wait2]
So, [Hero], please[Line]find my grandson![Wait2]
Thank you so much,[Line][Hero]. Take my ship.[Line]It's all yours now![Wait2]
What! They burnt your[Line]ship? Now we have no[Line]single ship in this town![Wait2]
The only other town with[Line]ships is Uranbatol. But it's[Line]a long way from here.[Wait2][Line]Are you still determined[Line]to go?
Well then, stay here. You'll[Line]be fine.[Wait2]
Did you change your mind?[Wait2]
Uranbatol is very remote.[Line]It's far to the northeast. Go[Line]to Shade Abbey first.[Wait2]
Ask my son all the details[Line]about the journey.[Wait2]
Our son is just dying to see[Line]the circus.[Wait2]
My son is missing! Have you[Line]seen him?[Wait2]
Thank you so much for saving[Line]my son.[Wait2]
My father is the mayor of[Line]this fine town.[Wait2]
Please help us find our son.[Wait2]
Thank you, [Hero]![Wait2]
Head north to Shade Abbey.[Line]You shouldn't have much[Line]trouble finding it.[Wait2]
I love the circus![Wait2]
Thank you for saving me![Wait2]
Yep. The circus tent will be[Line]right over there.[Wait2]
Sorry, the circus people said[Line]to let no one in yet.[Wait2]
The mayor's grandson? Yes, he[Line]went in the tent and never[Line]came out! That's strange.[Wait2][Line]I'll let you in to look for[Line]him. Be careful. Some of[Line]those people look dangerous.[Wait2]
Be careful in there![Wait2]
It's my fault. I should have[Line]noticed he was in there too[Line]long. Thank you, [Hero]![Wait2]
Shade Abbey...it has some[Line]connection to Guardiana, but[Line]I can't think of it....[Wait2]
Whew! It's heavy. And hot![Wait2]
Crock the Genius, that's me.[Line]Look at my steam suit. Guntz,[Line]walk over here![Wait2]
I'm still working on it, but[Line]the steam suit is almost[Line]done.[Wait2]
Whew, heavy! Hot and heavy![Wait2]
Man, it's really hot. My back[Line]is burning up. This is just[Line]killing me![Wait2]
It's fixed! My steam suit[Line]finally works! Show him,[Line]Guntz. Walk over here.[Wait2]
Oh, well. Just a little more[Line]tinkering, that's all.[Wait2]
I don't care. Just please[Line]finish it and let me out![Wait2]
It still doesn't seem right.[Wait2]
Silence! Just do as I ask![Wait2]
OK, OK![Wait2]
It stopped! Not again![Wait2]
Oh, dear. Well, back to the[Line]old drawing board.[Wait2]
What a great role! The[Line]actor's life is for me![Wait2]
What a rotten role! I can't[Line]stand this much longer.[Wait2]
I always enjoy these plays.[Line]"The Glory of Runefaust"[Line]should be wonderful.[Wait2]
Go Runefaust! Go Runefaust![Wait2]
A fine play with strong[Line]performances all around. I've[Line]seen it many times already.[Wait2]
Pow! Bang! Smash![Wait2]
The play's about to begin.[Wait2][Line]It's about Runefaust routing[Line]Guardiana. Want to see it?[Wait2]
Too bad. It's wonderful![Wait2]
Go sit down. It's starting![Wait2]
Thank you for waiting. The[Line]show will now begin![Wait2]
Take that, you Guardiana[Line]wimp! And that! And that![Wait2]
Please don't kill me, mighty[Line]Runefaust knight, please![Wait2]
You're too weak to live, you[Line]lowly worm. Take that![Wait2]
Aiiieeee! You've killed me![Wait2]
So shall Runefaust's foes[Line]always fall![Wait2]
Clap! Clap! Clap![Wait2]
Thank you and come again![Wait2]
We're looking forward to your[Line]next visit.[Wait2]
This is the worst role. I[Line]should have quit long ago.[Wait2]
This is a great role. I wish[Line]I could play this forever.[Wait2]
I always enjoy these plays.[Line]"The Might of Light" should[Line]be wonderful.[Wait2]

You defeated my pets, but you[Line]won't bother me any more.[Line]You're going to burn![Wait2]
Burn, [Hero], burn![Wait2][Line]You'll serve as an example[Line]to all who dare[Line]oppose Runefaust.[Wait2]
Good riddance, insect![Wait2]
[Hero], run! The ship's[Line]going down![Wait2]

So sorry about the attack. We[Line]can't be too careful in these[Line]troubled times.[Wait2]
Otrant is the wisest among[Line]us. Follow his advice.[Wait2]
Beneath this building lies[Line]the Cavern of Darkness! A[Line]horrible place, they say![Wait2]
You made it through the[Line]cavern? No one has ever done[Line]that before![Wait2]
I am Otrant. You wish to find[Line]the key to the Accursed Door[Line]before Kane of Runefaust?
Then I cannot help you.[Wait2]
A legend tells that the Pool[Line]of the Ancients below is tied[Line]in with the Accursed Door.[Wait2][Line]To reach the pool, you first[Line]need the Orb of Light from the[Line]Cavern of Darkness.[Wait2][Line]Defeat the monsters in the[Line]cavern, and the orb is yours.[Line]Then return to me.[Wait2]
[Hero]! Enter the cavern[Line]and retrieve the Orb of Light![Wait2]
Use the orb at the pool[Line]behind the secret door below![Wait2]
The Orb of Light has chosen[Line]you, [Hero], to battle the[Line]evil that threatens Rune.[Wait2][Line]You are truly the servants[Line]of the Powers of Light,[Line]the Shining Force![Wait2]
Cross the sea from Rindo and[Line]go to the Eastern Continent.[Line]You must stop Kane![Wait2]
Do you want find the key to[Line]the Accursed Door before the[Line]Runefaust army finds it?[Wait2]
Have you already seen the[Line]Pool of the Ancients?
The pool lies beneath this[Line]building. They say it speaks,[Line]but only to a chosen few.[Wait2]
An amazing sight, eh?[Wait2]
You spoke with the spirit of[Line]the pool? I though that was[Line]only a legend![Wait2]
Hello! Don't usually get[Line]guests here. I'm thought to[Line]be rather strange, you know.[Wait2]
I have something for you.[Line]It's inside that fake monster[Line]over there. Go get it![Wait2][Line]It's a Domingo egg. A very[Line]useful item. Hatch it when[Line]you get a chance![Wait2][Line]Come back before you leave.[Line]I may have some information[Line]for you.[Wait2]
To cross the sea, take a ship[Line]at Rindo.[Wait2][Line]Goodbye, [Hero]![Line]Perhaps we'll meet again![Wait2]
[Hero] checks[Line]the machine.[Wait2]
You did well to reach this[Line]room. Have you ever heard of[Line]a place called Shade Abbey?
You young people think you[Line]know everything![Wait2]
It was founded long ago by[Line]folk from Guardiana. They[Line]know much of the Ancients.[Wait2]
Sorry. No time, no time![Wait2]
A strange aura is coming from[Line]the direction of Shade Abbey.[Line]Something evil is there.[Wait2]
Show the Orb of Light to[Line]Otrant. He'll know what you[Line]should do with it.[Wait2]
Now all shall know you as the[Line]Shining Force![Wait2]
Yes, I am Anri. What? What[Line]about Guardiana, and my[Line]father? Who are you?[Wait2][Line]I don't have to listen to this[Line]nonsense from someone I don't[Line]even know. Go away now![Wait2]
Wait, Princess Anri! Please[Line]listen to [Hero]![Wait2]
Nova![Wait2]
This is [Hero]. He is[Line]leading the fight against the[Line]Runefaust army.[Wait2]
But my father...the Sword of[Line]Light...and Guardiana...is it[Line]true, Nova?[Wait2]
Yes, your majesty, it is all[Line]true, I'm afraid.[Wait2]
I...I need to be alone for a[Line]while....[Wait2]
[Hero], Princess Anri is[Line]in great sorrow. Please[Line]go to her and talk to her.[Wait2][Line]Remind her of her duty to[Line]Guardiana. Our people need[Line]her now.[Wait2]

I know my duty now,[Line][Hero]. It is to hunt[Line]Kane down and make him[Wait2][Line]pay for what he did.[Line]I'll fight with you.[Line]I'm sure that's what my[Wait2][Line]father would want me to do.[Wait2]

I'll be at headquarters.[Line]Vengeance shall be ours![Wait2]

Great view, eh?[Wait2]
Drat! Not as good a view from[Line]down here. Better climb back[Line]up....[Wait2]
I'll make it someday![Wait2]
Welcome to my research room.[Line]I change humans into animals.[Line]Care to give it a try?
No curiosity, eh? When I see[Line]you next, I'll turn you into[Line]a frog![Wait2]
Very good! Let's start right[Line]away. Please stand over[Line]there.[Wait2]
Now, let's begin.[Wait2]
Yes! Success! What a tasty[Line]looking hen![Wait2]
If I can change humans to[Line]hens, we won't ever have to[Line]worry about food![Wait2]
Seeing you makes me hungry. I[Line]wonder what's for dinner?[Wait2]
Things are getting stranger[Line]around here every day![Wait2]
What in the world is a hen[Line]doing here?! Shoo, shoo![Wait2]
What's up, hen?[Wait2]
Old Gert turned you into a[Line]hen? That's easily fixed![Wait2]
Go away! Only cute animals[Line]can get past me![Wait2]
Well, what a cute little hen.[Line]Go on through![Wait2]
A hen went in and a person[Line]came out. What a great place[Line]to work, huh?[Wait2]
What a nice hen! How could[Line]someone eat a little hen?[Wait2]
Old Gert's up to her usual[Line]tricks. Someone here should[Line]be able to change you back.[Wait2]
Oh, [Hero]. It's nice[Line]of you to try to cheer me up.[Line]But I'm not fond of hens.[Wait2]
Next time, don't volunteer[Line]for experiments![Wait2]
Chicken soup tonight. Yum![Wait2]
Har, har! You're just in time.[Line]Would you like to observe?
Good. Sit quietly and watch a[Line]master at work![Wait2]
Who said you can refuse?[Line]Stand there and watch![Wait2]
I'm researching summoning[Line]demons. Now, I'm going to[Line]begin the experiment.[Wait2][Line]I shall summon a dreadful[Line]thing from my worst[Line]nightmares![Wait2][Line]Come forth, oh creature of[Line]Darkness! I conjure you[Line]forth![Wait2]
Huh?[Wait2]
You! When are you going to[Line]stop these tricks? Come [Line]home right now![Wait2]
Oops! Sorry, dear! I'll never[Line]do that again. Yes, I'll be[Line]good, honest![Wait2]
My name is Arthur. I used to[Line]be a knight. I'm not really a[Line]battle type. I like it here.[Wait2]
I want to fight again. I can[Line]help you against Runefaust.[Line]I'm coming with you![Wait2]

I don't know if I will ever[Line]see you alive again! Good[Line]luck![Wait2]
You're back! And you have the[Line]Orb of Light! Tell Otrant,[Line]quickly.[Wait2]
The spirit of the pool spoke[Line]to you? Go tell Otrant all[Line]that was said![Wait2]
How long I have waited for[Line]this summons! [Hero],[Line]you are a hero without peer![Wait2][Line]The legacy of the Ancients is[Line]an evil being that has been[Line]sealed away for 1,000 years.[Wait2][Line]Darksol now searches for the[Line]key to unlock that seal.[Line]You must stop him![Wait2]

Did you come here to see the[Line]famous Ring Reef, by any[Line]chance?
I thought so. But you can't[Line]go there right now. It's too[Line]dangerous to even get close.[Wait2]
Off the southern part of the[Line]island is Ring Reef. It's[Line]shaped like a ring.[Wait2][Line]Now there's a hole in it and[Line]water's pouring in and the[Line]current is very strong.[Wait2][Line]It's too dangerous to get[Line]close, and we don't know what[Line]to do about the hole.[Wait2]
Do you like fish?
You'll like it here, then.[Line]That's all we eat.[Wait2]
Too bad. That's all we eat.[Wait2]
Have you ever heard of[Line]Prompt?
I bet it's just an old[Line]legend. It doesn't really[Line]exist![Wait2]
It's said that descendants of[Line]the Ancients live there![Wait2]
Well, a guest! Would you like[Line]to hear a secret?
No curiosity, I guess.[Wait2]
I think our missing friar is[Line]in Ring Reef. Call it a[Line]hunch. Don't tell anyone![Wait2]
Greetings! We will gladly[Line]repair your ship, if you tell[Line]others of our lovely island.[Wait2]
I hope you are enjoying[Line]yourself. Rest until your[Line]ship is fully repaired.[Wait2]
Well, there's no law that[Line]says the king can't own a[Line]shop. Can I help you?[Wait2]

Hello, [Hero]. Remember[Line]me, Boken? The water's great,[Line]as long as you don't get eaten.[Wait2]
Do you know there's an[Line]enormous building under this[Line]island? It's amazing![Wait2]
Hi! I'm Shelra, Shell's mom.[Line]Are you planning to go past[Line]the buoys?
That's just as well.[Wait2]
The current could dash your[Line]boat against the rocks. Do[Line]you still want to go?[Wait2]
That's just as well.[Wait2]
OK, but be careful![Wait2]
([Hero]'s ship was caught by the[Line]strong current and dashed to[Line]pieces!)[Wait2]
Well, I'm glad to see you're[Line]up. You were thrown from your[Line]ship. I rescued you.[Wait2][Line]Strange doings! The water in[Line]Ring Reef vanished and a[Line]strange creature appeared.[Wait2]
It might have something to do[Line]with the legend of a Shining[Line]Path that leads to Metapha.[Wait2][Line]The legend says Metapha is[Line]a land of the Ancients.[Wait2]

Please rest here after your[Line]battle![Wait2]
What are you doing here? I[Line]must inform the master![Wait2]
[Hero], I was waiting[Line]for you. I used that mermaid[Line]to bring you here....[Wait2]
(It is the voice of the[Line]spirit from the Pool of the[Line]Ancients....)[Wait2]
The Shining Path lies behind[Line]this door. It leads to the[Line]land of the Ancients.[Wait2][Line]The key to the Accursed Door[Line]is there. I shall open the way[Line]to the Shining Path now.[Wait2]
No! Though it takes all of my[Line]remaining strength, you shall[Line]not use the path![Wait2]
(The voice of the spirit is[Line]heard again....)[Wait2]
Alas, the path is blocked.[Line]Listen. Two things are needed[Line]to break free Dark Dragon.[Wait2][Line]Darksol must get the key to[Line]the door, as well as the[Line]Manual of the Seal.[Wait2][Line]The manual is in Dragonia.[Line]You must stop Darksol. The[Line]seal must not be broken![Wait2][Line]Go to Prompt. There you[Line]should find another Shining[Line]Path.[Wait2]
[Hero], quick![Line]This place is collapsing![Line]Run![Wait2]
I sense that you shall return[Line]here at your journey's end.[Wait2]

Well, [Hero], your ship is[Line]repaired. Are you leaving[Line]immediately?
That's a good idea. Rest a[Line]little while.[Wait2]
I see. The payment for the[Line]repairs comes to 1,000,000[Line]coins. Will you pay it now?
What? Well, I can't let you[Line]go without paying![Wait2]
Why, don't you have enough[Line]money![Wait2]
You almost believed me,[Line]didn't you? I can't take[Line]money from you![Wait2]
I thank you on behalf of my[Line]people. Take care, and be[Line]sure to return later![Wait2]
Did you really fight evil[Line]creatures under Ring Reef?
I almost believed you![Wait2]
How scary! They were right[Line]under our fins![Wait2]
I was right. The Shining Path[Line]was here! Too bad it is now[Line]blocked.[Wait2]
What? Another Shining Path in[Line]Prompt? You must go there[Line]at once![Wait2]
It's me, Shell! You've been[Line]with the friar at Ring Reef?[Line]Did he tell you his secret?[Wait2]
It's amazing! You're both[Line]from Guardiana![Wait2]
His father was a friar of[Line]Shade Abbey. He was born in[Line]Guardiana! Amazing![Wait2]

School! Who needs it?[Wait2]
Be quiet and sit down, you[Line]little beasts![Wait2]
The people here are so[Line]backward. No one wants to[Line]learn anything.[Wait2]

Who says thinking is boring?[Line]I think about dinner all the[Line]time![Wait2]
Dark Dragon? Who cares? Let's[Line]talk about food![Wait2]
Have they posted the lunch[Line]menu yet? I can't wait![Wait2]
Ancients? Who are they, a[Line]group of minstrels?[Wait2]
Shining Force? What does that[Line]taste like? Is it good to[Line]eat?[Wait2]
Shining Path? Maybe the king[Line]knows about it.[Wait2]
Welcome. Visitors are[Line]always welcome.[Wait2]

This is Prompt Castle.[Line]Lovely, isn't it?[Wait2]
Whoa! I can't let anyone[Line]past. King's orders![Wait2]
Shining Path, eh? Are you[Line]sure you want to know about[Line]that?
The king might know something[Line]about it. He's always reading[Line]old books.[Wait2]
Good, me neither.[Wait2]

This is weird! Everyone's[Line]acting totally different![Line]Why?[Wait2]

Perhaps we should start a[Line]college here in Prompt.[Wait2]
I'm so bored. The classes are[Line]too easy.[Wait2]
Teacher! That calculation is[Line]wrong. The correct answer is[Line]34,765,492![Wait2]
I really don't have time to[Line]do this. I should be helping[Line]with the Shining Path.[Wait2]
What is going on? I feel like[Line]they're teaching me![Wait2]
These people are highly[Line]advanced. It's amazing![Wait2]
0
So much to know...so many[Line]questions to answer.[Wait2]
Could Dark Dragon be the[Line]legacy the Ancients left us?[Line]I think so.[Wait2]
Keep after Darksol,[Line][Hero]. He must not[Line]be allowed to succeed![Wait2]
We are all the descendants of[Line]the Ancients. We must prevent[Line]Dark Dragon's return![Wait2]
It's all up to you and the[Line]Shining Force![Wait2]
Metapha is said to be an[Line]amazing place. I hope to[Line]visit it someday.[Wait2]
Step right in. Visitors are[Line]always welcome here.[Wait2]

The castle used to stand on[Line]level ground. But years[Line]passed and it sank down.[Wait2]

These books were all written[Line]by the Ancients. Are you[Line]interested in them?
Ignorance is bliss, eh?[Wait2]
The Shining Path is described[Line]in detail. Too much detail.[Line]We're having trouble with it.[Wait2]
But we'll repair it,[Line]never fear![Wait2]
It's by the King's order. No[Line]one can leave here![Wait2]
You're going out? Enjoy[Line]yourself.[Wait2]
Welcome back! The King is[Line]waiting for you.[Wait2]
You are going out again?[Line]Enjoy yourself![Wait2]

You are too late. Darksol[Line]took the key to the Accursed[Line]Door.[Wait2][Line]Go to the eye symbol and[Line]use the Orb of Light.[Wait2]
I am Adam, a robot soldier. I[Line]will show you how to create[Line]the Chaos Breaker.[Wait2]

Bleu! This person is our[Line]friend. He's here to help![Line]Stop shaking, you baby![Wait2]
Oh, Karin, you are so mean![Wait2]
Just leave me alone![Wait2]
I was worried about Bleu, so[Line]I followed you. I really[Line]think he's hopeless![Wait2]
I am disappointed in[Line]you, Bleu![Wait2]
Help! Help! Bleu! [Hero]![Wait2]
That's Karin's voice![Wait2]
Well, dragon, if you want to[Line]save this girl, open that[Line]shrine door![Wait2]
Bleu! Don't listen to him![Line]Remember that you're a Sacred[Line]Dragon![Wait2]
This girl doesn't know how to[Line]shut up, does she?[Wait2]
Karin! No![Wait2]
What are you going to do[Line]about it, crybaby dragon?[Wait2]

Go back to your headquarters[Line]and get ready. Then you'll[Line]meet your doom![Wait2]
From the Shrine of Dragons[Line]comes a voice- "Hero of Light,[Line]come into the shrine."[Wait2][Line]"The Manual of the Seal[Line]awaits you inside."[Wait2]
A voice comes from the[Line]shrine- "Come to our shrine.[Line]You cannot leave."[Wait2]
(This door will open only for[Line]two heroes.)[Wait2]
Please, [Hero], come[Line]with me to the door. We[Line]must stop Darksol at any cost.[Wait2][Line]I want revenge for what he[Line]has done to me. We must[Line]keep that manual from him![Wait2]
(Two heroes. I have waited[Line]long for such as you! )[Wait2]
Ah, Kane. Feeling more like[Line]yourself now, are you?[Wait2]
This is the end, Darksol![Wait2][Line][Hero], get out now![Line]You'll only be destroyed[Line]if you stay![Wait2]
I can't let [Hero] go![Wait2][Line]Now that I have what I[Line]wanted, I have no further[Line]need of him![Wait2][Line]For you see, dear friends,[Line]I have both the key[Line]and the manual.[Wait2][Line]Dark Dragon will soon[Line]be free again![Wait2]
Go, [Hero], run![Line]I'll deal with Darksol![Wait2]
The mission of Dragonia- We[Line]guard the Manual of the Seal.[Wait2]
The Treasure of Dragonia-[Line]The Manual of the Seal is our[Line]only treasure.[Wait2]
We are very strong, but we[Line]have our vulnerabilities....[Wait2]
Baby dragons are fewer and[Line]fewer. Our numbers decrease[Line]every year....[Wait2]

Welcome to Shade Abbey! I'm[Line]rather busy now. Please see[Line]me later.[Wait2]
What are you doing here? Go![Wait2]
I'm so confused. I don't[Line]know what's real and what's[Line]my imagination.[Wait2]
Darksol suddenly appeared.[Line]He told us not to speak about[Line]the legacy of the Ancients.[Wait2][Line]Then he attacked our friar.[Line]The friar fought back, but[Line]Darksol overcame him.[Wait2]
Snarl![Wait2]
Help! My name is Amon. Please[Line]save Balbaroy. He'll die[Line]unless you help.[Wait2]
There's nothing back here,[Line]Never mind me.[Wait2]
Enjoy your visit, stranger![Wait2]
We seldom get visitors, but[Line]you are welcome.[Wait2]
Sorry, I can't talk while on[Line]guard duty.[Wait2]
Huh? Am I alive or dead?[Line]Where am I?[Wait2]

I am a master alchemist. I[Line]can make anything! Can I help[Line]you?
First you must help me.[Wait2]
But I need your help![Wait2]
To cure Zylo, I need to make[Line]Lunar Dew. But to do that,[Line]I need Moon Stone![Wait2][Line]You must go to the quarry,[Line]find Moon Stone, and[Line]bring it back to me![Wait2]
I have been waiting for[Line]warriors of the Shining[Line]Force. Are you one of them?
Alas, we need heroes badly![Wait2]
Great! You must help us. The[Line]Runefaust army took our men[Line]to dig in the quarry.[Wait2][Line]They're looking for a weapon[Line]of the Ancients, a Laser Eye.[Line]Diane can lead you there.[Wait2]
If Zylo were sane, he could[Line]surely help you.[Wait2]
I really feel sorry for Zylo.[Line]Do you want to hear about[Line]him?
Oh, well, it's your loss![Wait2]
The Runefaust army poured[Line]something into Zylo's drink.[Line]It made him crazy.[Wait2][Line]We had to lock him up to[Line]protect ourselves![Wait2]
Don't go this way! You'll be[Line]forced to work in the quarry[Line]with everyone else.[Wait2]
Please be careful. Those[Line]Runefaust monsters are[Line]deadly![Wait2]
Talk to my mother first.[Wait2]
If you're going to the quarry[Line]to rescue the men, you can[Line]count me in![Wait2]

Good luck to you and Zylo.[Wait2]
You beat them! We're free![Line]Thank you.[Wait2]
You beat them! We're free![Line]Thank you.[Wait2]
Thank you so much for all[Line]you've done.[Wait2]
You even saved Zylo. How can[Line]we ever thank you enough?[Wait2]
We're all grateful, but we're[Line]still worried about Zylo.[Wait2]
We'll be fine here, even[Line]without Zylo.[Wait2]
Please save Zylo! Ask the[Line]alchemist to make Lunar Dew![Wait2]
So, Zylo was saved, but he's[Line]going with you? We're going[Line]to miss him....[Wait2]
I want revenge! Please, can I[Line]join the Shining Force?
Wait! I must protect Bustoke.[Line]I'll join you some other[Line]time.[Wait2]
It 's just as well. I'll stay[Line]here and defend Bustoke.[Wait2]
Kokichi never listens to me[Line]when he's doing research.[Wait2]
I'm helping Kokichi to figure[Line]out how to fly.[Wait2]
...Hum, hmm....[Wait2]
What are you doing? Don't[Line]touch anything, you meddler![Wait2]
New in town, eh? Go out back[Line]and I'll show you my latest[Line]invention.[Wait2]
Watch carefully![Wait2]
Here I go![Wait2]
Good luck, Kokichi![Wait2]
Well, it didn't work this[Line]time either....[Wait2]
It always looks good at[Line]first, then something goes[Line]wrong. It never fails.[Wait2]
Another failure. I'm starting[Line]to think Kokichi should just[Line]give up.[Wait2]
You! Did you bring[Line]Moon Stone?
Not yet? Then we cannot save[Line]Zylo! You must get it![Wait2]
Yes, that is Moon Stone.[Line]I will make Lunar Dew[Line]immediately.[Wait2]
Here you go. Lunar Dew![Line]Zylo will make a[Line]full recovery.[Wait2]
Quick![Line]Take the Lunar Dew to[Line]Zylo immediately![Wait2]
Good, Zylo was saved! It's[Line]all because of my medicine![Wait2]
What! You don't have it?[Line]Well, where is it?[Wait2]
Please save Zylo![Wait2]
Return here after you get[Line]Lunar Dew. You'll be in great[Line]danger without it![Wait2]
Do you really want me to open[Line]the prison door?
That's too bad. You're the[Line]only one who can save him.[Wait2]
Please be careful![Wait2]
What do you want? Leave me[Line]alone or I'll tear you apart![Wait2]
([Hero] poured[Line]Lunar Dew into[Line]Zylo's mouth!)[Wait2]
Yuk! Awful taste. But I'm[Line]myself again. What a relief![Wait2][Line]I can never repay you for[Line]this, but I'm going to[Line]join the Shining Force![Wait2]

General Elliott is one of[Line]the greatest warlords[Line]of Runefaust.[Line][Wait2]But, I'm sure he is not evil of heart.[Line][Wait2]He was the one who saved[Line]us when a group of bandits[Line]invaded this town.[Wait2]
Then I don't have to tell you[Line]to watch out for sudden[Line]moves.[Wait2]
I hear the engine. It's[Line]almost time to leave.[Wait2]
Are you [Hero]?
The guy in the corner wants[Line]to talk to you. He says it's[Line]very important.[Wait2]
Oh, sorry. Never mind.[Wait2]
Say, that was General Elliott![Line]A fine being, so they say.[Wait2]
I have to pack up soon, or[Line]I'll miss the train![Wait2]
Who are you? I can't let any[Line]old stranger enter here![Wait2]
We travel all over Pao[Line]Prairie. And we're getting[Line]ready to leave right now![Wait2]

Just look! Don't touch it, or[Line]the train will start to move.[Wait2]
Everything is ready! Full[Line]power! Wow, this feels great![Line]Makes me feel alive![Wait2]
Greetings, [Hero]! I am[Line]General Elliott of Runefaust.[Line]Will you listen to me?[Wait2]
Good, for what I have to say[Line]should interest you....[Wait2]
No matter, you must hear what[Line]I have to say....[Wait2]
Runefaust has been corrupted[Line]by Darksol. He came from[Line]nowhere to sway our king.[Wait2][Line]Darksol told King Ramladu[Line]that the world would[Line]be his to rule forever.[Wait2][Line]All he needed was the legacy[Line]of the Ancients, Darksol[Line]claimed. Our King listened.[Wait2][Line]Though I hate Darksol and his[Line]plans, I am a loyal subject[Line]of King Ramladu.[Wait2][Line]When we meet next,[Line][Hero], it will be on the[Line]battlefield![Wait2][Line]Our king is fully under[Line]Darksol's influence. All this[Line]warfare is Darksol's doing.[Wait2]
If you defeat me in battle,[Line]please free Runefaust from[Line]Darksol's clutches![Wait2]
I am Queen Koron. Have you[Line]enjoyed your visit? I think[Line]we're ready to leave.[Wait2]
Everything is ready, your[Line]highness. We can leave any[Line]time you wish.[Wait2]
0
Well, let's not be rude to[Line]our visitor. Is it OK with[Line]you if we move along?
Please let me know when you[Line]are ready.[Wait2]
We'll be leaving now. Good[Line]luck. Please step outside.[Line]It's time for us to go![Wait2]
Hey, are you [Hero]?[Line]My name is Vankar. Did[Line]you hear about me in Pao?
Good, good, I was pretty[Line]famous there. But now I'm[Line]looking for adventure.[Wait2]
I was a guard there, but I[Line]slept on duty too much. They[Line]fired me.[Wait2]
I heard about you in Pao. I'm[Line]joining up! No, no, don't[Line]thank me, it's my pleasure![Wait2]

Whoa! It won't stop! I'll be[Line]right back, I think. Just[Line]wait a moment.[Wait2]
I'm joining up, youngster. I[Line]figure you need some[Line]experience on this team![Wait2]
I'll be at headquarters.[Wait2]
Welcome to Pao, a town that's[Line]truly on the move![Wait2]
If you want to destroy[Line]Balbazak, you should do it[Line]now, before Earnest gets killed![Wait2][Line]He's in there fighting[Line]all alone, yelling about[Line]vengeance. Go back him up![Wait2]
Balbazak is a dangerous[Line]opponent. He controls the[Line]fortress and Uranbatol.[Wait2]
Rollin', rollin',[Line]rollin'...the life of the[Line]nomad is the one for me![Wait2]

That Vankar! Where did he go?[Line]Do you know where he went?
You don't? Well, that's no[Line]help to me.[Wait2]
You saw him? Did you let him[Line]join your troops?
He's your problem now. He's a[Line]good fighter, when he feels[Line]like it.[Wait2]
Good for you. Serves him[Line]right. He's a good fighter,[Line]though.[Wait2]
I've got a great item here.[Line]This thing warms an egg and[Line]hatches it in seconds.[Wait2]
Let me know if you find any[Line]rare eggs. I really want to[Line]try it![Wait2]
You have an interesting egg[Line]there. Can I try to warm it?
Drat! I really want to try[Line]this egg warmer....[Wait2]
Great! Give it to me, please.[Wait2]

That castle is like a haunted[Line]house. Monsters are all over[Line]the place.[Wait2]
You've freed us from Darksol.[Line]Thank you![Wait2]

Darksol is gone! I'd feel[Line]better about it if I knew[Line]what he was up to.[Wait2]

I feel a strange aura. I fear[Line]that Dark Dragon is[Line]awakening![Wait2]
Mahato once told me a legend.[Line]Would you like to hear it?
Too bad! It's very[Line]interesting....[Wait2]
Runefaust and Guardiana are[Line]twin cities built to protect[Line]the Castle of the Ancients.[Wait2]
The gates prove it. Each city[Line]has one. Guardiana the west,[Line]and Runefaust the east.[Wait2]
I am Mahato. There is no time[Line]to lose, [Hero]. Darksol[Line]has gone to the gate![Wait2][Line]You must follow him. Go back[Line]through town. The guards will[Line]let you through now.[Wait2][Line]King Ramladu will try to[Line]stop you, for he is Darksol's[Line]creature now![Wait2]
Fight well! You are the only[Line]one who can defeat Ramladu![Wait2]
[Hero]! You have[Line]defeated King Ramladu, but[Line]a far greater task awaits.[Wait2][Line]Darksol has sealed the Gate[Line]of the Ancients behind him,[Line]but there is another way....[Wait2]
Use the Chaos Breaker at the[Line]westernmost point of the[Line]coast. There's a legend....[Wait2][Line]The Chaos Breaker can raise[Line]the Castle of the Ancients[Line]out of the depths of the sea.[Wait2][Line]The gate will then open.[Wait2]
Shining Force! We no longer[Line]obey Darksol. Are you going[Line]to stop him?
That's certainly the healthy[Line]choice.[Wait2]
Go inside. Mahato awaits you[Line]with some information.[Wait2]
You made it? You've fought[Line]through the castle? But keep[Line]going, for Darksol awaits![Wait2]
No one gets through to[Line]Runefaust Castle. Mahato's[Line]orders.[Wait2]
Mahato said to let you[Line]through. The castle is down[Line]this path.[Wait2]
No one gets through to[Line]Runefaust Castle. Mahato's[Line]orders.[Wait2]
Take great care. You're our[Line]only hope to be rid of[Line]Darksol.[Wait2]
I am the ninja Hanzo. I shall[Line]join your battle.[Wait2][Line]I await you at[Line]headquarters.[Wait2]

Bathing in the sun sure does[Line]feel good![Wait2]
We kids can do anything. We[Line]even have a leader--Karin.[Wait2]
I'm patrolling to watch for[Line]danger.[Wait2]
Adults are bad! They just[Line]gave up on dragons![Wait2]
Woof! Woof![Wait2]
Hey, don't bother me! Can't[Line]you see that I'm busy?[Wait2]
Cluck, cluck.[Wait2]
We made a strong barricade in[Line]case the adults try to come[Line]back![Wait2]

No adults allowed! Go home![Wait2]
Your shirt is dirty. You[Line]should wash it![Wait2]
There used to be lots of[Line]Sacred Dragons, but now[Line]there's only one, Bleu.[Wait2]
We decided to protect the[Line]Sacred Dragons by ourselves.[Line]We don't need any help![Wait2]
Boo! Hiss! Down with adults.[Wait2]

He's the last Sacred Dragon.[Line]Talk to Karin about him.[Wait2]

You're up! You were half[Line]dead when you got here. Glad[Line]you're feeling better.[Wait2][Line]Be sure to see Karin before[Line]you leave. You're in Rudo,[Line]by the way.[Wait2]
Talk to Karin, please![Wait2]
All the children of this[Line]village are friends of Bleu.[Wait2]
You are going to Dragonia?[Line]Please help Bleu![Wait2]
I am Karin. We need your[Line]help. To the east is the town[Line]of Dragonia.[Wait2][Line]The Runefaust army is near[Line]Dragonia. But Bleu is all[Line]alone in the village.[Wait2][Line]And he's our friend, a baby[Line]Sacred Dragon. Please help[Line]Dragonia and Bleu![Wait2]
Did you see my sister Krin?[Line]Her pet is a little wild, so[Line]be careful![Wait2]
Soon, the exit will be[Line]cleared out. Please go to[Line]Dragonia as fast as you can![Wait2]
When you see Bleu, tell him[Line]to be a brave Sacred Dragon![Wait2]

Yip! Yip![Wait2]
I'm Krin, Karin's sister! I[Line]know lots of stuff. I read[Line]all these old books![Wait2]
This book has some great[Line]stuff in it. Should I tell[Line]you about it?
Shucks. It's pretty good.[Wait2]
The Manual of the Seal is[Line]a book that contains several[Line]chants.[Wait2][Line]One of these breaks the[Line]seal on Dark Dragon, another[Line]renews the seal.[Wait2][Line]The Ancients used the second[Line]chant to bind Dark Dragon[Line]1,000 years ago.[Wait2][Line]The manual has been guarded[Line]by the Sacred Dragons for[Line]centuries.[Wait2][Line]You must go to Dragonia to[Line]try to stop Darksol from[Line]taking the manual![Wait2][Line]Bleu cannot do it on his own![Wait2]
Oh, you want to hear about it[Line]after all?
Please let me know if you[Line]find the Manual of the Seal[Line]in Dragonia.[Wait2]
Grrrr...![Wait2]
Be quiet, Brit! He's a guest![Wait2]
Who are you? Brit? Oh, he's[Line]my pet.[Wait2]
Hi! Nice to see another[Line]stranger in town. By the way,[Line]are you [Hero]?
I didn't think so. He's said[Line]to be heroic looking.[Wait2]
Great! I'm Lyle and I've been[Line]looking for you. I'm joining[Line]up to fight evil![Wait2]

You won't regret it! I'll[Line]wait at headquarters.[Wait2]
Heave, heave! Heave-ho![Wait2]
I made a barricade to keep[Line]the adults out. But you can't[Line]get out until I open it up.[Wait2]
Heave! Heave!...Ah![Wait2]
What timing! I'm about to[Line]remove the last rocks![Wait2]
Heave-ho! Heave-ho![Wait2]

Bleu's going with you, right?[Line]Please tell him, good luck![Wait2]
Woof![Wait2]
Thanks for helping Bleu. He[Line]needed a hero![Wait2]
Cock-a-doodle-doo![Wait2]

Sorry about being nasty[Line]earlier. You're OK.[Wait2]
I had a dream about you last[Line]night. You were going into[Line]a castle shaped like a skull?[Wait2]
Bleu's great, isn't he?[Wait2]
My parents are coming back[Line]soon! I'm so excited![Wait2]
Tell Bleu to return as soon[Line]as he can. We'll miss him![Wait2]

I just heard that the rest of[Line]the adults are coming back![Wait2]
Have you seen Krin?
She's very excited about[Line]something she found.[Wait2]
Oh. Well, never mind then.[Wait2]
Welcome back, [Hero]![Line]I told everyone about Bleu.[Line]Thank you so much![Wait2][Line]Krin said she found[Line]something in the old records.[Line]It sounded important.[Wait2]
Have you seen Krin yet? She[Line]really wants to see you.[Wait2]
I think you should go to[Line]Prompt first. It's south[Line]of here.[Wait2]
But be careful! There are[Line]lots of monsters out there![Wait2]
I checked the old records and[Line]read something interesting.[Line]Do you want to hear about it?
C'mon, it's important![Wait2]
Listen- "The Manual of the[Line]Seal holds the key to[Line]awakening Dark Dragon.[Wait2][Line]He must never awaken. The[Line]Sacred Dragon must keep the[Line]manual from evil hands."[Wait2][Line]Also, there's something here[Line]about a sword called[Line]the Chaos Breaker....[Wait2][Line]It says that when the sword[Line]is used at the westernmost[Line]point of the land....[Wait2][Line]The Castle of the Ancients[Line]will rise from the depths[Line]of the sea.[Wait2][Line]Whatever all that means![Wait2]
Did you get the manual?
So where is it?[Wait2]
Darksol has it? Oh, my. This[Line]is bad, very bad! He can use[Line]it to awaken Dark Dragon![Wait2]
I have no idea what to do....[Wait2]
Wait! Don't leave yet. Karin[Line]wants to talk to you.[Wait2]
Be careful out there. There[Line]are lots of weird creatures[Line]wandering around![Wait2]
Wait! Don't leave yet. Karin[Line]wants to talk to you.[Wait2]

This castle isn't much, but[Line]it's all we have![Wait2]
Go up the stairs to see King[Line]Kusuko, ruler of Prompt.[Wait2]
I found Kane. I hope he gets[Line]well soon.[Wait2]
Sorry. No time for idle[Line]chatter.[Wait2]
The Manual of the Seal holds[Line]many secrets. The way to[Line]rouse Dark Dragon, of course.[Wait2][Line]But the way to renew the[Line]seal is also contained with[Line]the manual's pages.[Wait2][Line]Also, there is a robot that[Line]can be activated with the[Line]help of the manual.[Wait2]
This is grandpa's room. He's[Line]pondering something difficult.[Line]You'd better not disturb him.[Wait2]
Elders are waiting for you.[Line]Please listen to their words.[Wait2]
Deep thought requires[Line]absolute silence. Please let[Line]me resume thinking.[Wait2]
Our records say that the[Line]Ancients used flying machines[Line]to cross the sea in minutes![Wait2]
Run along now, youngster. I'm[Line]doing vital research here.[Wait2]
The Ancients had amazing[Line]powers. But Dark Dragon nearly[Line]destroyed them.[Wait2][Line]After a long struggle that[Line]ravaged all of Rune, Dark[Line]Dragon was defeated.[Wait2][Line]The Ancients placed him in[Line]their castle and sank it[Line]beneath the sea.[Wait2][Line]But what could we do against[Line]Dark Dragon if he got[Line]loose now?[Wait2]
This is King Kusuko, ruler of[Line]Prompt. Be polite or we'll[Line]throw you into prison![Wait2]
The king has something he[Line]wants to say to you.[Wait2]
Do as the king asks. We must[Line]all wait for further reports[Line]from our troops.[Wait2]
Please save Alef and Torasu![Wait2]
All hail King Kusuko![Wait2]
Talk to King Kusuko.[Wait2]
All hail King Kusuko![Wait2]
These stairs lead to the[Line]prison. Nothing to see down[Line]there now.[Wait2]
King Kusuko imprisoned you[Line]because he cares about us.[Line]Please forgive him.[Wait2]
Great equipment, huh? Don't[Line]ask what it does, I have no[Line]idea![Wait2]
Can you save Alef and Torasu?[Wait2]
Door? What door? Oh, that[Line]door! It's nothing. Forget[Line]all about it. Run along now.[Wait2]
The Shining Path begins here[Line]and leads to Metapha. We need[Line]more time to repair it.[Wait2][Line]Come back later, please.[Wait2]
What brings you to Prompt?[Line]Ancients? Dark Dragon? What[Line]is this nonsense?[Wait2][Line]You're a spy, aren't you,[Line]sent by our enemies to find[Line]our weaknesses. Answer me![Wait2]
I thought so. We have a place[Line]for toads like you....[Wait2]
You're lying! We know how to[Line]deal with spies![Wait2]
Guard! Toss him in prison![Wait2]
(The thick bars seem[Line]unbreakable.)[Wait2]
OK, now I'm really lost. Hey,[Line][Hero]! What's up? Don't[Line]worry, I'll let you out![Wait2]
[Hero], I think I'm going[Line]to stop wandering and settle[Line]down. Maybe in Waral. See ya![Wait2]
King Kusuko! A message from[Line]those who left for the Tower[Line]of the Ancients![Wait2]
Alef and Torasu say Darksol[Line]seems unbeatable. They cannot[Line]hold out for long![Wait2]
You heard the report, I[Line]assume. The Tower of the[Line]Ancients is east of here.[Wait2][Line]When I heard Darksol was[Line]there, I sent troops to[Line]stop him.[Wait2][Line]He is trying to raise the[Line]Castle of the Ancients from[Line]beneath the sea.[Wait2][Line]He must be stopped before[Line]he awakens Dark Dragon.[Wait2][Line]Since my troops have failed,[Line]it's all up to you now,[Line][Hero].[Wait2]
Rest for now, until all is[Line]ready for your journey.[Wait2]
Sorry. No visitors until he[Line]recovers from his wounds.[Line]Poor guy, whoever he is.[Wait2]
Sssh. He's resting.[Wait2]
Please let us take care of[Line]Kane.[Wait2]
ZZzzzzz[Wait2]
His name is Kane. Someone[Line]found him seriously injured.[Wait2]
When Kane recovers his[Line]strength, you two can talk.[Line]Just be patient![Wait2]
P...please...King Kusuko,[Line]...let [Hero]...go to...the[Line]Tower of...the Ancients....[Wait2]
Rest, Kane. There will be[Line]time to talk later.[Wait2]
I...owe [Hero] a great[Line]deal...please...let him go....[Wait2]
(Kane passes out.)[Wait2]
Huh?[Wait2]
I give in. [Hero]! You[Line]have my permission to enter[Line]the Tower of the Ancients![Wait2]
Welcome to Prompt Castle![Wait2]
This castle isn't much, but[Line]it's the only one we have![Wait2]
King Kusuko is waiting.[Wait2]

Kane? He rushed out of the[Line]castle without saying a word.[Wait2]
I'm so sorry. I didn't know[Line]that Kane was gone...I really[Line]didn't....[Wait2]
There is a Pool of the[Line]Ancients in Metapha. Use the[Line]Orb of Light there.[Wait2]
Go, [Hero]. You must[Line]stop Darksol! With the Chaos[Line]Breaker, you have a chance.[Wait2]
An ancient legend says that a[Line]Sword of Light and a Sword of[Line]Darkness will unite.[Wait2][Line]This union will create a new[Line]sword to combat Darkness![Wait2]
So the legends are true...the[Line]Chaos Breaker does exist![Line]Tell King Kusuko![Wait2]
We are doomed, [Hero]![Line]Darksol is awakening[Line]Dark Dragon.[Wait2][Line]It cannot be stopped.[Wait2]
No! Do not give up. All is[Line]not yet lost![Wait2]
Who are you to barge into my[Line]throne room?[Wait2]
I am Otrant of Manarina, King[Line]Kusuko. Have you heard of the[Line]Chaos Breaker?[Wait2]
Yes, a sword spoken of in[Line]ancient legends....[Wait2]
When ultimate evil arises, a[Line]Sword of both Light and[Line]Darkness can defeat the evil.[Wait2][Line][Hero] has the Sword of[Line]Light, and Kane had the Sword[Line]of Darkness....[Wait2]
Kane left it with me.[Line][Hero], take both swords[Line]to Metapha.[Wait2][Line]Once there, you can create[Line]the Chaos Breaker. Here[Line]is the Sword of Darkness.[Wait2]
Your hands are full! Organize[Line]your belongings and come back[Line]again.[Wait2]
Kane left the Sword of[Line]Darkness for you. He said[Line]he thought you might need it.[Wait2]
Now, leave for Metapha![Line]Create the Chaos Breaker and[Line]stop Darksol![Wait2]
([Hero] receives the[Line]Sword of Darkness.)[Wait2]
Long ago, [Hero], the[Line]Ancients founded the cities of[Line]Guardiana and Runefaust.[Wait2][Line]Though back then, Runefaust[Line]was called Protectora...[Line]...Where was I? Oh, yes.[Wait2][Line]Guardiana held the western[Line]Gate of the Ancients, while[Line]Protectora held the eastern.[Wait2][Line]Though Protectora has fallen[Line]into evil hands, the gate[Line]remains and still functions.[Wait2]
Darksol entered the Castle of[Line]the Ancients through the[Line]eastern gate.[Wait2][Line]You must enter Runefaust and[Line]fight your way to the gate.[Line]Good luck, [Hero]![Wait2]
Go to Metapha and get the Chaos Breaker![Wait2]
At last, the Chaos Breaker![Wait2]
You must go to Runefaust now.[Line]See Mahato there. He is[Line]honest and can help you.[Wait2]
Please take good care of Alef[Line]and Torasu.[Wait2]
Listen to Otrant. Dark Dragon[Line]must remain sealed or the[Line]world is doomed![Wait2]
I'm sorry that Kane is dead.[Line]You must ensure that he[Line]didn't die in vain![Wait2]
You must renew the seal on[Line]Dark Dragon, or he will[Line]ravage the world![Wait2]
Thank you for saving Alef and[Line]Torasu![Wait2]
An army has been spotted[Line]leaving Runefaust. It's headed[Line]our way![Wait2]
The Shining Path is open at[Line]long last. Now you can leave[Line]for Metapha![Wait2]
Welcome back, [Hero].[Line]King Kusuko is anxious[Line]to hear your story![Wait2]
Go see King Kusuko![Wait2]
The Shining Path is only open[Line]if you possess the Orb of[Line]Light. Carry it with you.[Wait2]
Though the spirit of the pool[Line]is no more, her words still[Line]live in your heart.[Wait2]

Well, what a surprise! Rarely[Line]do we have guests in such a[Line]remote area.[Wait2][Line]I am a friar, though I may[Line]not look it.[Line]How can I help you?[Wait2]
Strange things are in the[Line]woods. They give me the[Line]creeps.[Wait2]
Greetings, [Hero]. I have[Line]been waiting for you.[Wait2]
I am Gong. I have fought the[Line]evil of Runefaust for many[Line]years. I will aid you.[Wait2]
I will join your troops.[Wait2]
You again, [Hero]? How[Line]unfortunate for you![Wait2]
Now I must be off to summon[Line]Dark Dragon. But don't worry.[Line]Someone is waiting for you.[Wait2]
King Ramladu will serve my[Line]purposes one last time, then[Line]I will have no need for him![Wait2]
I must be going. Do enjoy[Line]your meeting with Ramladu.[Line]Dark Dragon arises soon![Wait2]
Keep going...Darksol...top of[Line]tower...hurry....[Wait2]
We can't go on...you must[Line]stop Darksol....[Wait2]
Don't...worry about us...get[Line]Darksol before...it's too[Line]late....[Wait2]
Maybe you are...strong[Line]enough...to succeed where[Line]we...failed....[Wait2]
Too late, [Hero]![Wait2]
It has begun! The Castle of[Line]the Ancients is rising from[Line]the depths.[Wait2][Line]Soon I will awaken Dark[Line]Dragon and he will rule[Line]the world![Wait2]
And now, the time to end your[Line]meddling is here![Wait2]
I call upon the Darkness to[Line]crush this....No! It cannot[Line]be![Wait2]
Kane![Wait2]
Yes, Darksol. And this time I[Line]will stop you![Wait2]
Fool! I am now many times[Line]mightier than when we last[Line]met. Your doom is here![Wait2]
Arrrggghhh![Wait2]
I have no more time to waste[Line]with you two. Dark Dragon[Line]awaits![Wait2]
I'm dying...[Hero]...[Line]go to... Metapha...[Line]hurry![Wait2]
(Kane dies!)[Wait2]
[Hero], there is no time[Line]for sorrow. Alef and Torasu[Line]are with us. On to Metapha![Wait2]
